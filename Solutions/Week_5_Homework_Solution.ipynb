    "Write two Python programs, part one and part two, to extract information about COVID-19 vaccination statistics for various countries.\n",

    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Parse the vaccinations.csv file according to the guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first row has a description of each column.\n",
    "- Each row after that contains one day's cumulative vaccination data for one country.\n",
    "- The last row of data for each country contains the most recent vaccination data for that country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should output the most recent statistics for the percentage of each country's population that has been vaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary to store the percentage value for each country. For one country, this percentage value can be updated multiple times until you have the most recent value stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should ignore any rows of the file that have either a blank or a value of zero for the total_vaccinations_per_hundred.\n",
    "- Percentages should be output with exactly one digit after the decimal point.\n",
