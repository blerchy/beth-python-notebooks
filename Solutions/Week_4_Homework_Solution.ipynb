    "### Assignment Specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python Program to compute how to give change with fixed denominations. Maximize larger denominations, using smaller ones only as needed. Use the following denominations, in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \\$20\n",
    "2. \\$10\n",
    "3. \\$5\n",
    "4. \\$2\n",
    "5. \\$1\n",
    "6. \\$0.25\n",
    "7. \\$0.10\n",
    "8. \\$0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Pennies cannot be given as change (the requirements are unclear on this, so I'm assuming that we simply round down to the nearest $0.05 increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of using floating point (decimal) numbers, multiply everything by 100 and use integers instead (i.e. 20 becomes 2000, 0.05 becomes 5, etc.)\n",
    "2. Use a dictionary to store the number of each denomination you'll return to the customer.\n",
    "3. You must use at least one *for* loop.\n",
    "4. Do not output denominations that you do not need to give back.\n",
    "5. You must use the *.format()* method to write your output.\n",
    "6. Output must match the example spec below"
